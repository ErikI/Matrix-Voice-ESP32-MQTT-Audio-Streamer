# Matrix-Voice-ESP32-MQTT-Audio-Streamer

This is my first commit for the Matrix Voice ESP32 MQTT Audio Streamer.
Currently, you can configure some values like samplingrate, topic, mqtt host and such.
Code will be self documenting ;)

The Audio Steamer is designed to work as an Snips Audio Server, see https://snips.ai/
Feel free to make comments, I am not a c / c++ programmer so a lot well be not very neat programming.

Future plans are to make the Matrix Voice's ledring respond in some colorfull fashion. All running standalone esp32.

To be able to run it, first try to get the demo esp32 of Matrix running, see https://www.hackster.io/matrix-labs/get-started-w-esp32-on-the-matrix-voice-d01e0d
If you have got that running, you will be able to flash this software as well.
